Revision and Rewriting: Use the 'revisionAndRewriting' prompt to identify areas needing improvement.\n7. Feedback Analysis: Use the 'feedbackAnalysis' prompt to process beta reader feedback.\n8. Polishing: Use the 'languagePolishing' prompt to refine the writing style.\n9. Final Proofreading: Use the 'finalProofreading' prompt to catch any remaining errors.\n10. Synopsis Writing: Use the 'synopsisWriting' prompt to create a compelling book summary.\n11. Market Research: Use the 'marketResearch' prompt to gather insights for marketing the book.\n\nThroughout the process, use the 'themeAnalysis' and 'paceAnalysis' prompts as needed to ensure consistency and engaging pacing.\n\nYour task is to execute this process, calling each prompt at the appropriate time and managing the flow of information between steps.
